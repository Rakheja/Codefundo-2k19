## IDEA

The idea is to create an application that aims to incentivize voting. It will be an online portal which will keep track of the people who have voted and facilitate the government to reward them for their participation in the democracy. The application will also serve as a platform for the citizens of the country to apply for voters' ID, apply corrections in their ID, and make the voting process hassle-free for the general public.  


Inspiration for the idea was the relatively low participation of Indian citizens in the voting process. We tried to find the reasons behind it, and one of the primary reasons is the hassle-full process of obtaining voters' ID. 

We will sync our application with government records to easily keep track of the people who have voted. Since this application deals with sensitive data, security is the topmost priority. We will use Azure Blockchain to achieve this goal.
